The `package-lock.json` has been created and the `Dockerfile` has been updated. The issue should now be resolved. I'll inform the user about the changes and what to do next.

I've made the following changes:

1.  **Generated `package-lock.json`**: I ran `npm install` in the `apps/api` directory to create the necessary `package-lock.json` file.
2.  **Updated `Dockerfile`**: I replaced the deprecated `npm ci --only=production` with the current `npm ci --omit=dev` for installing production dependencies.

You should now be able to deploy your application successfully. Since the app has already been created on Fly.io, you should use the `flyctl deploy` command.

You are currently in the `/Users/pskinnertech/Dev/gai/3/askleo-medical-scribe-ai/apps/api` directory, so you can just run:

```bash
flyctl deploy
```
